URGENT
========
* use "git clone" when installing bundles(?)
* ship with a default bundle plist
* implement "new file" and "new folder" in explorer menu + confirmation dialog
* = command (or remove from Edit menu)
* gq command (or remove from Edit menu)
* text objects (or remove from Edit menu)
* vi navigation of symbol list
* disable bookmarks button in toolbar?

BUGS
====
* clicking a binary file (pdf, image) in explorer opens as text
* switch undo direction after bundle command
* o and O commands with a count does the wrong thing
* caret location is messed up after undo of bundle command
* jumpy selection in symbol list when clicking symbol
* vi always has a newline at EOF
* searching is slow on large files, naÃ¯ve implementation
* yk and yj commands don't position caret correctly

IMPORTANT
=========
* cmd-t fuzzy search feels *slow*
* bundle-specific nu startup scripts (nu/main.nu)
* global nu startup script in application support folder
* toggling explorer always opens to 200px
* re-use open help windows
* preference for wrapping
* dot should work with ! filters
* :write filename
* :write !program
* :read
* :read !program
* :edit! => revert
* support a count in C and h commands
* highlight caret after goto line
* check if plists return expected classes (failed to parse?)
* allow ex commands when there is no open document


FEATURES
========
* zt, zz, zb (scroll cursor to top, center, bottom)
* ZZ and ZQ, and make :q just close the current document (?)
* p/P with a count
* J with visual selection, and J with a count
* +/- commands
* global marks (A-Z)
* open alternative file (.h/.c/.m)
* :map commands
* preference pane for editing macros?
* honor bundle ordering when showing ambiguous items menu
* move split views relative each other
* convert horizontal split to vertical and vice versa
* message how many lines yanked
* :e# => open alternate file
* set incsearch
* set smarttab
* set listchars
* search and replace
* symbol list should use same filtering algorithm as file explorer
* > command should not indent empty lines
* option to hide the tab bar
* option to open files in the same view per default (ie, not tabs)
* vimtutor
* implement R
* implement c-w in insert mode
* escape after creating new line should blank the line
* history in explorer view + go back/forward with swiping
* :normal!
* = (re-indent)
* global shell variables (in preferences)
* project shell variables
* draw marks in gutter view
* action menu on document tabs with
  * close tab
  * close others
* gq<motion> = reformat through 'formatprg' (ship with par)
* dynamic headIndent paragraph style dependent on line indentation
* cdpath setting? looked at by :edit


LONG TERM FEATURES
==================
* syntax / scope inspector, like in espresso.app
  * remove show_scope: and shift-ctrl-p mapping
* scope injection
* preview location while searching/traversing symbol list
  - esc cancels, go back to before
  - enter/click shows yellow highlight
* block selection with ctrl-v + block editing
* autocommands (or events)
* undo tree + visualisation (check out Gundo)
* integrated terminal

IDEAS
=====
* option whether to open an untitled file in a new window / project (?) why?
* ODB Editor suite? why?
* make vi keys preferred over bundle key equivalents?


:wnext (?)

:command calling for bundle commands? arguments?

0<C-D> in insert mode removes all indentation

<C-W> in insert mode
