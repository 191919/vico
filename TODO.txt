BUGS
====
* h doesn't accept a count
* bundle commands time out when presenting ui

* get rid of ViBgView
* switch undo direction after bundle command
* o and O commands with a count does the wrong thing
* caret location is messed up after undo of bundle command
* jumpy selection in symbol list when clicking symbol
* vi always has a newline at EOF
* searching is slow on large files, naÃ¯ve implementation
* yk and yj commands don't position caret correctly
* search should be useable as motion command!

IMPORTANT
=========
* tweak smart typing pair invocation
* always open an untitled document when opening a project?
* indented paste
* showAsHtml + dontFollowOutput (?)
* Reload themes!
* Reload bundles!
* cmd-t fuzzy search feels *slow*
* toggling explorer always opens to 200px
* dot should work with ! filters
* :write filename
* :write !program
* :read
* :read !program

* highlight caret after goto line
* allow ex commands when there is no open document


FEATURES
========

LONG TERM FEATURES
==================
* syntax / scope inspector, like in espresso.app
  * remove show_scope: and shift-ctrl-p mapping
* scope injection
* preview location while searching/traversing symbol list
  - esc cancels, go back to before
  - enter/click shows yellow highlight
* block selection with ctrl-v + block editing
* autocommands (or events)
* undo tree + visualisation (check out Gundo)
* integrated terminal

IDEAS
=====
* option whether to open an untitled file in a new window / project (?) why?
* ODB Editor suite? why?
* make vi keys preferred over bundle key equivalents?


:wnext (?)

:command calling for bundle commands? arguments?
