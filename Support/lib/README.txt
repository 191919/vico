This directory should contain object files that aren't supposed to be executed directly,
such as shared libraries and bash source-files. Data files should not be here.


# updated 2011-03-02, Martin Hedenfalk.
Removed unused and unsupported scripts.
I've tried to remove textmate-specific stuff, but there's still some left.
I'd like to replace all of this with nu code.
