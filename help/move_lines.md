# Moving by lines

You can jump to the top, middle and bottom line of the screen with the
<kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> commands. To remember them,
you can think of <kbd>H</kbd> as the **H**igh line, and <kbd>L</kbd> as
the **L**ow line.

The <kbd>}</kbd> and <kbd>{</kbd> commands move by paragraphs. A
paragraph is considered delimited by an empty line.

The <kbd>G</kbd> command jumps to the last line. With a count, it jumps
to that line number. For example, <kbd>10G</kbd> jumps to line number
10. The <kbd>gg</kbd> command is similar to <kbd>G</kbd>, but defaults
to the first line if no count is given.
