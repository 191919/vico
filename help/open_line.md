# Opening lines

To open a new line below the current line, use the <kbd>o</kbd> (lowercase
letter o) command. The new line is automatically indented (if autoindent
is enabled) and insert mode is entered.

Use the <kbd>O</kbd> (capital letter O) command to insert a new line
*above* the current line.
