# Working with split views

Vico can show the same or different documents side by side in split views.
Views can be split either horizontally or vertically. There is no limit on the
number of splits you can create, but more than a couple in the same tab tends to
be hard to manage.

Most keys that manages split views begin with <kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;</kbd>.
To split the current view, use the <kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;s</kbd> command, ie first
press <kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;</kbd> and then press the <kbd>s</kbd> key. If you use
<kbd>v</kbd> instead, you get a vertical split.

If you want to move a split view to a new tab, use <kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;T</kbd>.

To navigate between split views, use <kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;</kbd> followed
by a vi motion key (<kbd>hjkl</kbd>) or one of the arrow keys. The
<kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;w</kbd> command moves to the next split view. The
<kbd>&lt;ctrl-w&gt;W</kbd> moves to the previous split view.

The [explorer](explorer.html) and [symbol list](symbols.html) can also be used
to open files or symbols in split views.
