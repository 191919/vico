# Settings for indentation

The <kbd>shiftwidth</kbd> setting controls how large an indentation is in terms
of spaces. This is different from the <kbd>tabstop</kbd> setting that specifies
how large an actual tab character is.

If <kbd>shiftwidth</kbd> is set to 4 and <kbd>tabstop</kbd> is left at the
default 8, one indentation will use 4 spaces, but two indentations will use one
tab.

Use the <kbd>expandtab</kbd> setting to always use spaces when indenting.

When the <kbd>autoindent</kbd> setting is enabled, a new line will use the same
amount of indentation as the previous line. The <kbd>smartindent</kbd> setting
adds syntax-aware rules for increasing and decreasing the automatic indentation.
