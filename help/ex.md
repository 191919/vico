# The ex command line

The ex command line is normally hidden under the status bar at the
bottom of the window. The command line is used to enter ex commands
(<kbd>:</kbd>), filter commands (<kbd>!</kbd>) and search patterns
(<kbd>/</kbd> and <kbd>?</kbd>).

Lines entered on the command line are remembered in a history. Use up and
down arrows to recall history.
