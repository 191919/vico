# Movement commands

You can use the normal arrow, page up and page down keys in Vico to move around.
But there are more movement commands available in vi than there are cursor keys.
And with the vi way of navigating, you don't have to reach all the way across
the keyboard.

Most vi tutorials begin with describing the <kbd>hjkl</kbd> keys for moving
left, down, up and right. If you're new to vi, you may want to wait with them.
They do feel a bit awkward at first, but once you've learned to use them, you
realize they aren't so bad at all.
