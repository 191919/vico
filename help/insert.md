# Inserting text

To insert text you must first enter insert mode. The most basic way to
enter insert mode is with the <kbd>i</kbd> (insert) command. You will
notice you are in insert mode when the caret changes from a block caret
to a thin caret.

When you are done inserting text, press the <kbd>&#x238B;</kbd>
(escape) key to go back to normal mode.

The <kbd>i</kbd> command enters insert mode at the current location.
To enter insert mode <em>after</em> the current location, you use the <kbd>a</kbd>
(append) command.

If you want to append text to the end of the current line, no matter where
on the line you are, use the <kbd>A</kbd> command.

Similarly, the <kbd>I</kbd> command moves to the first non-blank character
on the current line and enters insert mode there.
