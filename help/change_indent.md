# Changing indentation

While in insert mode, use the <kbd>ctrl-t</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl-d</kbd> commands
to increase and decrease the indentation level of the current line.

To manually shift a block of text left or right, use the <kbd>&lt;</kbd> and
<kbd>&gt;</kbd> [operators](operators.html). It's easy to use them in
[visual mode](visual.html) by first selecting the text that should be indented.

The <kbd>=</kbd> command can be used to automatically indent text based on
the current language syntax.

The above commands uses the indentation settings for the current scope to
determine how to indent.
