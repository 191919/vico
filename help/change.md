# Changing text

The <kbd>c</kbd> (change) [operator](operators.html) deletes the affected text
and enters insert mode. The <kbd>cw</kbd> is one of the most used commands: it
changes one word. The change command is not considered complete until you exit
insert mode with <kbd>&#x238B;</kbd> (escape). Back in normal mode, you can
repeat the change with the [dot command](dot.html).

Use the <kbd>r</kbd> (replace) command to change a single character. Vico waits
for you to type the new character. In [visual mode](visual.html), the
<kbd>r</kbd> command changes the whole selection to the same character.
