# Changing text

Use the <kbd>r</kbd> (replace) command to change a single character. Vico waits
for you to type the new character. In [visual mode](visual.html), the
<kbd>r</kbd> command changes the whole selection to the same character.

The <kbd>c</kbd> (change) [operator](operators.html) deletes the affected text
and enters insert mode.
