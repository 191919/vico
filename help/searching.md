# Searching

To search, use the <kbd>/</kbd> command and enter a regular expression
in the command line at the bottom of the window. This command is also
available by the standard <kbd>&#x2318;F</kbd> key.

If the <kbd>ignorecase</kbd> option is set, case is ignored. If the
<kbd>smartcase</kbd> option is also set, case is ignored only if the
search pattern does not include any uppercase characters.

To search backwards, use <kbd>?</kbd>.

To quickly search for the word under the caret, use <kbd>*</kbd>. The
<kbd>#</kbd> command searches backwards instead.

You can repeat the last seach command in the same direction with the
<kbd>n</kbd> command. The upper case <kbd>N</kbd> command reverses the
direction.
