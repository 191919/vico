# Moving by characters

To move one character to the left, you either use the arrow key, or the
<kbd>h</kbd> command. The <kbd>l</kbd> command move to the right.

The <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> commands move one line down and up,
respectively.

To help you remember which key move in what direction, think of <kbd>h</kbd>
being the leftmost key among these, and <kbd>l</kbd> the rightmost.
The <kbd>j</kbd> key can be thought of a downward pointing arrow, and, with a
little imagination, the lowercase <kbd>k</kbd> is pointing upwards.
