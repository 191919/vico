Vico includes the par paragraph formatter by Adam M. Costello.
Par is available from http://www.nicemice.net/par/.
The par version shipped with Vico includes the par_1.52-i18n.3.diff.gz patch
by Jérôme Pouiller that adds multibyte support.

    The files listed in the Files List section above are each Copyright
    2001 by Adam M. Costello (henceforth "I", "me").

    I grant everyone ("you") permission to do whatever you like with
    these files, provided that if you modify them you take reasonable
    steps to avoid confusing or misleading people about who wrote the
    modified files (both you and I) or what version they are.  All
    official versions of Par will have version numbers consisting of
    only digits and periods.

    I encourage you to send me copies of your modifications in case I
    wish to incorporate them into future versions of Par.  See the Bugs
    section for my address.

    Though I have tried to make sure that Par is free of bugs, I make no
    guarantees about its soundness.  Therefore, I am not responsible for
    any damage resulting from the use of these files.
